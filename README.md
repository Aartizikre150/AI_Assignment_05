Use the Hyperparameter Tuning notebook to find the 'optimal' hyperparameters using MAB approach. Specifically, follow the tutorial(s) on the BO package's GitHub to set up ranges of hyperparameters, and evaluation function for neural network performance, and (finally) run the BO procedure for at least 10 iterations. Use Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) acquisition function. Note that 'acquisition function' is also referred to as 'utility function'. Report the optimal combination of hyperparameters and the result produced in terms of validation set accuracy.
